## Welcome to my Test Automation Portfolio

This Github page is intended to act as both a reference point for my test automation portfolio, and a template for yours. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/askherconsulting/testautomationportfolio.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
